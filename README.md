# Symphonia

Symphonia is a web-based music-sharing platform. Register, create a group for you and your friends, and start adding **your** recommendations of Spotify songs. See what others are listening to, and expand your Spotify playlist.

Symphonia is built with Next.js 13 and [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase). It is a work-in-progress.
